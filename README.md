This program implements a Library Management System (LMS) designed to manage a list of patrons in a library. It provides a console-based menu for users to perform tasks such as adding, removing, and viewing patrons.
Note: DV-LMS.jar opens properly when opened via command line, but does not open when directly double-clicked, despite the manifest file being formatted correctly. As such, a batch file (DV-LMS.bat) is included, which will open the .jar file so long as both are in the same folder.

Features:

Load patron list from file - Allows the user to load a premade list of patrons from an external file

View all patrons - Allows the user to view a list of all patrons in memory

Add patron manually - Allows the user to manually add a patron to the list

Delete patron - Allows the user to delete a patron from the list using their unique ID number
